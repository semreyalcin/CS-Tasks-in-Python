When you try to open the files some may open and close instantly or close before you see the output.
To prevent this you can add input() at the end of your file so it won't close itself until you enter something.
In order to see the code, you can install sublimetext and open the files with it or any other text editor(ex: notepad).
I recommend using sublimetext because it highlights everything and code becomes a lot readable.
